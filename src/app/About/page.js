              Our Story
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-6 text-center text-lg text-gray-600">
              Founded in 2024, our journey began with a simple yet powerful
              idea: to bridge the gap between traditional driving education and
              modern technological solutions. As passionate advocates for road
              safety and skill development, we recognized the need for a more
              flexible, accessible, and effective way to teach driving. In a
              rapidly evolving world, we understood that conventional driving
              schools often fell short in meeting the diverse needs of learners.
              Our commitment to innovation led us to create a platform that
              connects aspiring drivers with qualified instructors, offering
              tailored lessons that fit into busy lifestyles. From humble
              beginnings, we have grown into a trusted name in driving
              education. Our platform has helped thousands of learners gain the
              skills and confidence needed to navigate the roads safely. By
              embracing technology, we have streamlined the learning process,
              allowing users to schedule lessons at their convenience, track
              their progress, and receive real-time feedback from experienced
              instructors. Our story is one of resilience, adaptability, and a
              relentless pursuit of excellence.
